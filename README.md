University in Pula.

## Technologies in use

The actual used technologies are just Express and Nodemon, though I choose to use many more, such as TypeScript, Vitest,
TSX, a few libraries and approaches that I've learned during an internship and in my free time. They are immensely
helpful for the full software engineering experience.

## Project structure guide

- most exercises will have the following `npm run` lifecycle scripts: `build`, `start`, `dev`, `test:dev` and
  `test:prod`,
- additional exercise descriptions are listed in the `package.json` file `description` properties, usually written in
  Croatian for the professors if they're grading my work
